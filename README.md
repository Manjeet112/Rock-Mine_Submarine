# Rock-Mine_Submarine
A submarine sends SONAR waves. The waves bounce back differently from:  🪨 Rocks (natural)  💣 Mines (man-made, dangerous)  ML learns these patterns and predicts Rock (R) or Mine (M).  📊 The Dataset (SONAR Dataset)  Each row = one SONAR signal Each column = energy of reflected signal at a frequency band
Input: 60 SONAR values

2️⃣ ML model finds patterns
3️⃣ Output:

R → Safe (Rock)
M → Danger (Mine)
💡 Common models used:
Logistic Regression
SVM (Support Vector Machine)
Random Forest
